# Multi-dimensional-Image-Classification
An Ensemble Deep Transfer Learning Model for Multi-dimensional Image Classification of Histological Prostate Biopsy Patterns
It's Private data, Dataset (whole slide image) was collected from the Yonsei University Severance Hospital, Korea. The slide images were scanned into a computer at 40× optical magnification using the Apereo AT2 scanner (Leica Biosystems Inc., Vista, CA, USA); the resolution was 0.25 μm/pixel.
The processed dataset included 1,932 and 10,000 WSI-cropped images of 256 × 256 and 512 × 512 pixels, respectively.

Stain normalization and deconvolution techniques was applied as a preprocessing step.
The stain normalization approach was applied by transforming both the source and reference image to the LAB color space.
Furthermore, stain deconvolution technique was applied to transform the RGB color image into stain color spaces (i.e., Hematoxylin & Eosin).
